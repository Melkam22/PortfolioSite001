                <p>
                        I joined DCI (Digital Career Institute) in August 2018 to start my web-development education. I have learned and I am still learning a lot on daily basis. I learned and used many programming languages and libraries such as HTML, SCC, SASS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVA-SCRIPT, REACT, NODE.JS, mongoDB, MYSQL, EXPRESS etc. which I used to make websites and small apps. I already practiced a variety of technologies and am highly motivated for and interested in programming. I am therefore looking forward to joining a company and apply what I have already leaned and continue to learn more. I am eager to broaden my knowledge every day and to code amazing apps.

                <p>
                        As a teacher and a translator, I worked in various organizations and with people from different age groups, educational backgrounds and different nationalities. My intercultural communication skills and my intercultural sensitivity was a great advantage for this task. Furthermore I developed and applied my self-confidence in public speech, group-working, brainstorming and collective problem solving.

                        I managed to learn a lot during my one year stay at DCI and I have already applied much of the coding technics that I learned. I am learning a lot from different sources and I am always eager to apply new things. I managed to make different web-sites and various mini apps which could perform various functions. I invite you to see my portfolio here:
                        Furthermore, I am eager to build on my experience and join a motivated and motivating team and accomplish more nice things together.
