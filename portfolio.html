                <h3>General-Education</h3>
                <p>
                    After high school I was enrolled in Addis-Ababa University school
                    of Commerce and I was graduated in 2004 with Diploma in Banking and
                    Finance. After that, I have pursue my higher eduction and I have
                    studied foreign-language and communication in French language and
                    and I was graduated with distinction in 2009. After acquiring my
                    degree I had won a scholarship and I have studied my master degree
                    in France at the University of Rouen. I have graduated in end of
                    2011 in Teaching French as a Foreign Language. Since then until
                    I have started my web development course I have worked as a french
                    language teacher and translator in different local and international
                    organizations, including Addis-Ababa University and African-Union.

                <p>
                    Since, I have a big interest in it and web-development I have
                    enrolled in a one month orientation course in DCI in august 2018.
                    Then, without wasting any time, I pursue my one year program in
                    the same institute and since then I have learned and I am learning
                    a lot. During my time in DCI, I have learned and used many technologies
                    with which I have managed to make web-sites and many small apps.
                    I have learned many technologies and due to time constraints I didn't
                    manage to apply all of them, but considering my high motivation and
                    insatiable interest for programming, I am looking forward to join
                    a company and apply what I have learned and to learn more in order to
                    to broaden my knowledge and to code more amazing apps.

                <p>
                    As a teacher and a translator, I have worked in various organizations,
                    and I have worked as well with people from different age group,
                    educational background and different nationalities too. This experience
                    has given me a precious opportunity to learn and develop intercultural
                    competenties. Beside the intercultural aspect, this experience has given
                    me a great opportunity to develop my self confidence in public speech,
                    group-working, brainstorming and collectively solving problems.

                <p>
                    Though I am novice to the web-development domain and my experience
                    is very small, I have managed to learn as much as possible during
                    my stay at school and I have managed as well to apply as much as
                    possible what I have learned during my stay at school. Without limiting
                    myself to my teachers, I was learning a lot from various sources and I
                    am always eager to apply new things. With what I learned, I have
                    managed to make different web-sites and various mini apps which
                    could perform various functions. Furthermore, I am eager to join motivated
                    and motivating team and accomplish more nice things.
